Here you can find the AI Enemies System, for the moment I have used a simple state machine but I think it could be extended to take some ideas some GOAP system. Something to change here I could merge EnemyController and EnemyBehaviour since it is quit the same thing. I implemented a quad tree to allow the game to have a lot of zombies around the city.

This was just the first implementation for a project
