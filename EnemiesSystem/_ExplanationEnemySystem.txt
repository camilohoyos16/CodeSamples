Here you can find the AI Enemies System, for the moment I have used a simple state machine but I think it could be extended to something alike to GOAP system.
Something it could be changed here is merge EnemyController and EnemyBehaviour since it is quit the same thing. I implemented a quad tree to allow the game to have a 
big amount of zombies around the city.

This was just the first interation in the implementation. The project got cancelled.
